    <p>There is a certain idea that seems to go along well with the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument">Kalam Cosmological Argument</a>. This is the idea that a god doesn’t need a reason to exist other than him being necessary. In this case god is usually defined as a separate entity that exists in the metaphysical world and the one who created the universe. I don’t think this is a good idea, and I will explain why. Keep in mind that I’m not against the idea that something must necessarily exist, such as something necessarily needing legs to walk. I’m just against the idea that this necessity is the only reason required for the legs to exist. This may seem obvious to some, but the reason I’m writing about it is because I often hear it as a defense against “Then why does god exist?” as an attempt to stop the infinite regress of “why …?”s at the god defined above.</p>

<p>I’d like to illustrate an example to show the problems that arise from the idea. Imagine for a second that we don’t know whether a thing $x$ exists. Now, what if someone told you that $x$ exists because it was created by $y$, and $y$ exists because it needs to have created $x$. This is pretty obviously a circular argument, as the premise (“$y$ exists”), which is somewhat hidden, assumes the conclusion (“$x$ exists”), rather than supporting it.  Breaking the argument down, it would look like this:</p>
